## ?? ONE LINE TEST

Copy EXACTLY this (just one line):

```

**That's it. Seriously, that's the entire test.**

## HOW TO RUN IT

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5000/onecompiler-test.html`

2. See the big text box labeled "Code" on the left?

3. Delete everything in it

4. Type (or paste) exactly:
```
print("Test")
```

5. Make sure "Python" is selected in the dropdown

6. Click the green button that says "Run Code (Direct API)"

7. Wait... wait... wait...

8. Look at the "Output" section on the right

---

## WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE

Output should show:
```
Test
```

Just that word "Test"

---

## IF YOU SEE "Test" ? IT WORKS! ?

Congratulations! Now try:

### Test 2 - Numbers
```
print(5+5)
```
Should show: `10`

### Test 3 - Loop
```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

```
0
1
2
```

### Test 4 - JavaScript

## IF YOU SEE ERROR ? TROUBLESHOOT

### Most Common Issues:

**Issue 1: "Code editor is empty!"**
- Fix: Make sure you pasted the code in the Code textbox
- The text should appear in the big box

**Issue 2: Nothing happens**
- Check: Is there a spinning circle?
- Wait: Give it 5 seconds
- Check: Did you click the right button? (green "Run Code" button)

**Issue 3: Shows "Error: ..."**
- Check: Is Python selected?
- Check: Is the syntax correct?
- Check: Did you copy the code exactly?

**Issue 4: Still not working**
- Open DevTools: Press F12
- Click: Console tab
- Look for: Red error messages
- Copy and paste the error here

## ANOTHER SIMPLE TEST (If First One Fails)

Just numbers:
```
print(1)
```

That's the simplest possible code. Just prints the number 1.

If this doesn't work, something is definitely wrong.

- etc.

Just click the first one! The code loads automatically.

Then click "Run Code"

## THAT'S LITERALLY IT

1. Click Test 1 button
2. Click Run Code button
3. See output
4. Done!
